# TripPilot - 3-Minute Demo Script

> **Positioning**: Your personal travel guide that doesn't just suggest — it thinks.

---

## 0:00 - 0:20 | Opening

**On screen**: Split screen — left: someone overwhelmed by tabs and maps. Right: TripPilot logo.

**Narration**:

> "Rome. One day. The Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, good pasta... but what order? Will the Pantheon still be open when you get there?"
>
> "TripPilot doesn't just give you a list. It figures out if your day actually works."

---

## 0:20 - 0:50 | Act 1: Just Tell Me What You Want

**On screen**:

- Open TripPilot
- User holds mic: _"One day in Rome. I love history and want real Italian food."_
- Gemini returns structured suggestions as tappable chips

**Narration**:

> "Talk naturally. TripPilot uses Gemini to understand what you mean — not just what you said."
>
> "History lover? Here's the Colosseum, the Forum, the Pantheon. Tap to add."

**On screen**:

- User taps chips → places appear in the list

---

## 0:50 - 1:20 | Act 2: Add What You Want — We'll Sort It Out

**On screen**:

- User sets starting point (hotel)
- Adds 5 places in random order
- Taps "Plan"

**Narration**:

> "Pick your places. Don't worry about the order — that's our job."

**On screen**:

- User casually adds another place
- Removes one
- List updates instantly

**Narration**:

> "Change your mind anytime. TripPilot recalculates."

---

## 1:20 - 1:55 | Act 3: The Magic — Gemini Thinks, Then Fixes

**On screen**:

- Route calculation animation
- Timeline appears with times, distances, opening hours
- A red warning briefly flashes: "Pantheon — arrives after closing"
- Warning resolves, order changes

**Narration**:

> "Here's what makes TripPilot different."
>
> "First, we calculate the facts — distances, opening hours, how long you'll spend at each stop."
>
> "Then Gemini looks at the whole picture. It spots the problem: you'd arrive at the Pantheon after it closes."
>
> "But Gemini doesn't just warn you — it decides the fix. Move Pantheon earlier. Minimal change, maximum impact."
>
> "The route updates. Now your day works."

**On screen**:

- Final timeline: green checkmarks
- Budget estimate appears

## 1:55 - 2:30 | Act 4: Save It, Share It, Go

**On screen**:

- Tap "Save" → saved to My Trips
- Tap "Share" → posted to Community
- Tap "Calendar" → Google Calendar events created
- Tap "Navigate" → Google Maps opens

**Narration**:

> "Done planning. Save it for later. Share it so others can use your route."
>
> "Or just go — add to your calendar, open Google Maps, and start walking."

---

## 2:30 - 3:00 | Closing

**On screen**:

- Quick montage: voice input → chips → route → maps
- TripPilot logo + "Built with Gemini 3"

**Narration**:

> "TripPilot turns 'I want to see Rome' into a day that actually works."
>
> "Gemini doesn't generate your plan — it validates and repairs it. That's the difference."
>
> "Built with Gemini 3. Plan smarter. Travel better."

- Keep it conversational, not technical
- ~3 minutes total
